Chicken biriyani was so good and the chicken was fresh and tender ,rice was well cooked and overall was great\\\\n\\\\n2. Mutton biriyani was very very good and tasty and It had plenty of mutton pieces...\"), (\\'Rated 5.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  This place just cool ? with good ambience and slow music and having delicious food is where you find peace. Staff very friendly and they have maintained the place so clean. The price is average for what the quantity of food they serve.\\\\nThom yum Thai soup was best and was treat to mouth, roti was soft with that vilaythi paneer was perfect to have for veggie foodies, in rice we tried burnt garlic fried rice with vegetables and it was the perfect thing to end.\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \"RATED\\\\n  Quiet a good family type of place.. too calm and usually we don\\'t find crowd here.. panner curry and the deserts is what we had tasted.. they wer really good but we found it a little expensive\"), (\\'Rated 2.0\\', \"RATED\\\\n  I had a very bad experience here.\\\\nI don\\'t know about a la carte, but the buffet was the worst. They gave us complementary drink and momos before the buffet. The momos were really good.\\\\nThe number of varieties first of all was very disappointing. The service was very slow. They refilled the food very slowly. The starters were okay. The main course also was so so. There was two gravies with roti and some rice with raitha. They had chats, sev puri and pan puri, which was average. But the desert was disappointing. They had gulab Jamun and chocolate cake. The jamun was not cooked inside. There was a cold blob of raw dough inside. The chocolate cake also was really hard and not that good.\\\\nOverall the buffet was a bad experience for me.\"), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \"RATED\\\\n  Food: 8/10\\\\nAmbience:8/10\\\\nStaff:8/10\\\\nOne of the good places to try north Indian food...but depends on ur taste buds. Not everyone will like all the items here. Specially when u r particular abt sweet and spicy food.\\\\nThere\\'s buffet available too.\\\\nWe had ordered paneer uttar dakshin and paneer kurchan..was amazing. The Gobi hara pyaz and mix veg were average.\"), (\\'Rated 3.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  A decent place for a family lunch or dinner.. well arranged in a simple manner. Food was tasty and the crew was very helpful and understanding..\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \"RATED\\\\n  Great place to have a heavy lunch. Good service.\\\\nThe chicken biryani was undoubtedly one of the best I\\'ve had. Biriyani and Lassi would be the suggested combo. Buffet is the talk of the place, so try according to your appetite. A nice place.\"), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  Its the one restaurant near katriguppe that i found was really good. Good variety of Chinese and thai dishes. Service is good and good place to hangout with family as its a peaceful place where noise is really less and good view.\\'), (\\'Rated 2.0\\', \"RATED\\\\n  Spice elephant soup SPL: almost manchow flavour soup.. Just above medium spicy\\\\n\\\\nLasooni fish tikka was awesome\\\\n\\\\nI don\\'t remember the dessert name but I have attached the photo .. It had vanilla ice inside wafers... Wafer was hell hard, egg smell chewy ... Nightmare dessert !\\\\n\\\\nTable leg space was very bad... I was so uncomfortable, the whole time kept on adjusting my legs\\\\n\\\\nNo parking\\\\n\\\\nFor the taste felt this is too costly\"), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  Zomato gold partner at this price. It was insane. They have really nice food. small place with very courteous staff and very cheap food for this ambience. Cost of soups is 80-100. Starters from 150-250. Main course 200-300. Cost for two was 800 for us.\\')]'"
